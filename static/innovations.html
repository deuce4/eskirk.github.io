                A5 was the first portaledge designed by John Middendorf.  It was created in reaction to his experiences with portaledges breaking, flys tearing, and nothing on the market feeling trustable.  The A5 portaledge established the paradigm in portaledge design.  After its release, its design was quickly copied by many of the bigger climbing companies, and the design is still being manufactured by them today.  The A5 revolutionized portaledge design.  This is how.

                The fly on the A5 was the first fly on the market to be expedition ready -- it was built with doors and vents, making a comfortable base for intense adventures. A5 Portaledges enabled a huge boom in big wall standards in the 1990's because for the first time, climbers were able to withstand Himalayan type storms.

                When John Middendorf created the first truly stormproof Portaledge in the 1980's and 1990's, a huge boom in big wall standards arose as climbers could withstand severe storms on the world's most remote big walls for the first time.
                John sold his company in 1998 and since then, his 1990's design has become the standard for all the major Portaledge manufacturers today. In 2016, while climbing with his family, John was asked by a climber in Arapiles why no one made the nice, strong, stormproof, and lightweight ledges like A5 used to make, and the conception for D4 was born.
                In the past year, using FEA tools along with ideas that had been floating around in his head for 20 years, John has created a revolutionary design, with four major cutting-edge innovations, and sure to become the new paradigm in Portaledge technology.
